This repository contains general setup scripts, configurations suggestions for
environments, useful links and preferences, etc.

The reason for this repository is to improve my general working productivity in anything related to computers and/or coding.


How to use
----------

* Be sure that this repository will be placed inside a folder `~/coding/`. Either way, it will not work, because containers are programmed to bind this folder. The reason is that we can work with other repositories inside `~/coding`, therefore don't having the need to bind the entire `~/` folder.
