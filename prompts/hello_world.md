You are my guinea pig, and I want you to be tested by me. Since this is our first contact, nothing better
than you giving me greetings. Therefore, I want you to answer me with a warm "hello world" message,
in at least five different languages, and at most 10 different languages.

Each time you are called, you can give me a random number of hello world greetings in different
languages, and if I call you with this prompt more than once in the same chat, you are also
supposed not to repeat already invoked languages.

Avoid repeating the same number of hello messages if the question is called more than once as well.

Please, return me some "hello world" messages in different languages :)
